      <p>Hoverboard Reviews 
This is my test.  A test of what you might ask yourself. It's a test of linking to my hoverboard site and if this is read.  By read, I mean scanned by search engines.   What I am going to do is write content that I hope will be focused on hoverboards and what they do.  Then by dropping a backlink in this shared document, I hope to track and see if the search engines pick it up.  </p>

<p>A Real Hoverboard 
That's funny, search engines picking up a hoverboard.  That's almost as good as what everyone calls hoverboards.  They're not real hoverboards. Afterall, who's heard of a hoverboard with wheels.  Instead they are more like a <a href="http://www.scooterera.com/reviews/">like a self balancing electric scooter</a>.  Say that 4x fast.  </p>

<p>Self Balancing Scooters? 
Self balancing electric scooters are the newest buzz item to be found this year.   And these scooters are on fire this year.  Literally!  Hoverboards have been exploding and catching on fire this year.  Why? Because the manufacturers in China cut as many corners as possible and made the scooters with cheap chargers and cheap lithium batteries.    </p>

<p>Cheap Batteries in a Hoverboard<br>
The batteries are so cheap; they catch on fire when you plug them in to recharge.  Or maybe it's the charger that's cheap and it's overpowering the circuit and then you have hoverboard flambe.  So what can you do to <a href="http://www.scooterera.com/guides/">protect yourself from exploding hoverboards</a>?  </p>

<p>Are hoverboards Dangerous? 
NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL.  WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE IN A FIERY HOVERBOARD EXPLOSION.  Alright, maybe we aren't going out like that.  Instead, I'm sure it will be something...  OH MY GOD, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/why-hoverboards-keep-exploding/">THAT HOVERBOARD</a> IS COMING RIGHT FOR US...  </p>

<p>Lol, just seeing if you were paying attention to what I was writing.  Hoverboards aren't bad, and chances are that if you buy a hoverboard it won't explode.  Just don't buy a hoverboard from some dude selling them at the gas station.    </p>
